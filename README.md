# LeetCodePracticeTracker

This repository serves as a showcase of my solutions to common LeetCode problems, complete with multiple solutions (sometimes in multiple languages), explanations, and time complexities. The deployed site is accessible [here](https://kazi27.github.io/LeetCodePracticeTracker/). As time goes on, the site will contain more of my solutions, explanations, and resources I use to prepare for my technical interviews and assessments.

## Overview

### About the Project

I wanted to have my solutions to the problems readily available at a glance whenever I needed to review solutions or forgot what I did so I made this simple website. It's hosted on GitHub Pages and is dedicated to presenting my solutions to various LeetCode problems. The solutions are implemented in Python (earlier problems in C++) and the website is built using simple HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The project will also utilize React and Node.js for enhanced functionality soon.

### Features

- **Problem and Solution Display**: Each page on the website features a problem statement along with solutions, explanations, and time complexities. The solutions come with step-by-step walkthroughs to help users (mainly just me and my friends) understand the thought process

- **Syntax Highlighting**: The website employs Prism and CSS for syntax highlighting in the C++ code snippets, enhancing code readability and presentation, tried to emulate vscode.

- **Typing Effect**: The problems list page employs a dynamic typing effect that mimics a hacker-style animation when the user hovers over a problem title.

- **Mouse Effect**: The website incorporates an interactive mouse effect where trails follow the user's mouse movements across the page adding a dynamic element to the user experience.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Solutions to LeetCode problems are implemented in Python mainly.

- **C++**: Solutions to LeetCode problems are implemented in C++ for some earlier problems.

- **HTML**: The website is built using HTML for the structure and semantics of the content displayed on various pages.

- **JavaScript**: The site utilizes JavaScript for dynamic behavior and interactivity like the navbar, matrix, and mouse effect to enhance the user experience.

- **CSS**: CSS as you might already have guessed is used to style and layout the HTML elements for an appealing and consistent presentation across different devices.

## Contribution

Contributions and feedback are welcome! If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional features you'd like to see, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Future Goals

- **Completion of LeetCode Problems**: The ultimate goal is to gradually complete all LeetCode problems, making this repository a comprehensive resource for algorithmic problem-solving.

- **Enhanced Functionality with React and Node.js**: Implementing React and Node.js will allow for a more dynamic and feature-rich website.

- **Community Interaction**: Feel free to ask me to invite you as a collaborator so we can add our solutions to the site as each problem can be solved in multiple ways, some easier than others to understand!
