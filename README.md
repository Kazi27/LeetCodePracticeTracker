# LeetCodePracticeTracker

This repository serves as a showcase of my solutions to common LeetCode problems, complete with explanations. The deployed site is accessible [here](https://kazi27.github.io/LeetCodePracticeTracker/). As time goes on, the site will contain more of my solutions, explanations and resources I use to prepare for my technical interviews and assessments.

## Overview

### About the Project

I wanted to always have my solutions to the problems available at a glance whenever I needed to review solutions or forgot what I did so I made this simple website. It's hosted on GitHub Pages and is dedicated to presenting my solutions to various LeetCode problems. The solutions are implemented in C++, and the website is built using simple HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The project will also utilize React and Node.js for enhanced functionality soon.

### Features

- **Problem and Solution Display**: Each page on the website features a problem statement along with a C++ solution. The solutions come with detailed explanations to help users (mainly just me and my friends) understand the thought process and also time complexities and why they are what they are.

- **Syntax Highlighting**: The website employs Prism.js and CSS for syntax highlighting in the C++ code snippets, enhancing code readability and presentation.

### Technologies Used

- **C++**: Solutions to LeetCode problems are implemented in C++.

- **HTML, JavaScript, CSS**: The website is built using standard web technologies, ensuring simplicity and accessibility.

- **React and Node.js** (Future Goals): Plans include incorporating React and Node.js for additional functionality and an improved user experience.

- **Prism.js**: Syntax highlighting is achieved through the use of Prism.js, providing an aesthetically pleasing and readable display of code snippets, tried to emulate vscode.

## Contribution

Contributions and feedback are welcome! If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional features you'd like to see, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Future Goals

- **Completion of LeetCode Problems**: The ultimate goal is to gradually complete all LeetCode problems, making this repository a comprehensive resource for algorithmic problem-solving.

- **Enhanced Functionality with React and Node.js**: Implementing React and Node.js will allow for a more dynamic and feature-rich website.

- **Community Interaction**: Feel free to ask me to invite you as a collaborator so we can add our solutions to the site as each problem can be solved in multiple ways, some easier than others to understand!
